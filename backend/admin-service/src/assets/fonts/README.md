Place a Unicode TTF font here for PDF exports (to properly render Vietnamese characters).

Recommended font: Google Noto Sans (NotoSans-Regular.ttf)
You can download from: https://www.google.com/get/noto/#sans-viet (download manually) and place the file here.

Expected path:
  src/assets/fonts/NotoSans-Regular.ttf

If the font file is present, the PDF export functions will register it automatically.
If the font is missing, PDFs will be generated with the default PDF font which may not render Vietnamese diacritics correctly.
